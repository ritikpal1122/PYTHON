- [43_map_filter_reduce.py](./43_map_filter_reduce.py)  
  Examples of using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` with lists and JSON data.

### 4. **File Handling**
- [Funtions/Built_in_fn/open.py](./Funtions/Built_in_fn/open.py)  
  Reading JSON files, extracting data, and handling file operations with `open()`.

### 5. **Database Connectivity**
- [Database_with_python/demo.py](./Database_with_python/demo.py)

### 6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- [Oops/Inheritance.py](./Oops/Inheritance.py)  
  Demonstrates single and multilevel inheritance, method overriding, and method resolution order (MRO).
- [Oops/Constructor_in_inheritance.py](./Oops/Constructor_in_inheritance.py)  
  Shows how constructors (`__init__`) behave in inheritance and how to use `super()`.
- [59_Operator_Overloading.py](./59_Operator_Overloading.py)  
  Operator overloading using magic methods like `__add__` and `__str__`.

### 7. **Requirements & Environment**
- [Example.run/requirement.txt](./Example.run/requirement.txt)  
  List of external dependencies (if any) required for running the codebase.
